*****GIT DAY 1***** (GIT PULL BEFORE GIT PUSH)
1. Create a project
2.Create a GITHUB REPOSITORY
    *go to github
    *Repositories>Create new Repository> first_git_project
3. Create a new Commit for the first time.
    *git init
    *git add . [adds everything]
    *git commit -m "first commit"
    *git branch -M main
    *git remote add origin https://github.com/Enxes/first_git_project.git
    *git push -u origin main
    *****Then your code should be pushed to github. REFRESH YOUR PAGE TO SEE THE CODE

NOTE: git status -> This is our friend. This can be used anytime to see the progress

4. Create a new SECOND COMMIT (used everytime?)
    *Create a new Java class under first_git_package: MySecondClass
    *Create a new commit and push the code to github (2nd and rest of the commits other than 1st)
        *git add .
        *git commit -m "added my second java class"
        *git push

5. ADDING SPECIFIC FILES
    *Create 2 JAVA classes: MyThirdClass, MyFourthClass
    *Create a commit with ONLY MyFourthClass
        * git status (to check which files are new and unadded)
            *red means unadded and new
            *green means added
        * git add "src/main/java/first_git_package/MyFourthClass.java"
        * git commit -m "commmiting my fourth class"
